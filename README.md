# zombieGame

Game made to the FBLA competition. The theme of this competition is a game that inspired by 1980s-style arcade games.

The game consists of multiple levels where you need to get the key and run to the door, while running away from the zombies.
The zombies will use the A* path finding algorithm to find the shortest path to the player.
